# **Contributing to Memory Match**

Pull requests are always welcomed.

Keeping in mind that this is a project made for the Udacity Web Developer Nanodegree and not for
huge distribution please adhere to some of the coding style rules to help keep the project as 
readable as possible.

## Code Style Guide

### JavaScript
* Use the JSDoc documentation style when commenting your code
* 2-space indentation ( I know a lot of people prefer to use the 4-spaces )
* Naming: functionNamesLikeThis, variableNamesLikeThis, ClassNamesLikeThis, methodNamesLikeThis, CONSTANT_VALUES_LIKE_THIS and filenameslikethis.js
* Because of implicit semicolon insertion, always start your curly braces on the same line as whatever they're opening

### CSS
* Use lowercase for selectors, properties, clasess and ids.
* 2-space indentation
